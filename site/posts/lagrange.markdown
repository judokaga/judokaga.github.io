Theorem (*Lagrange*):

>
If \\(H\\) is a subgroup of group \\(G\\), then \\([G:H] = o(G) / o(H)\\).

Proof:

>
We prove there is a bijection between every left coset in \\(G / H\\) and \\(H\\).
The relationship of \\(m \\in G\\) and \\(n \\in H\\) is \\(x^{-1}m = h\\), when the
left coset is \\(x / H\\). If \\(m_1, m_2 \\in x/H, m_1 \\neq m_2\\), then \\(x^{-1}m_1
\\neq x^{-1}m_2\\). If \\(h_1, h_2 \\in H, h_1 \\neq h_2\\), then \\(xh_1 \\neq xh_2\\).

>
So every left coset in \\(G / H\\) have the same number of elements, so \\([G:H] \\times
o(H) = o(G)\\).
